# Short-Hand if else statement


# Conclusion
# The shorthand syntax can be a convenient way to write simple if-else statements, especially when you want to assign a value to a variable based on a condition. However, it's not suitable for more complex situations where you need to execute multiple statements or perform more complex logic. In those cases, it's best to use the full if-else syntax.


a = 25
b = 26
print(a)if a>b else print("=") if a==b else print(b)
