# what is programming?
# Programming is a way for us to tell computer what to do. Computer is a very dumb machine and it only does what we tell it to do. Hence we learn programming and tell computer to do what we are very slow at computation. If i ask you to calcute 5+6, you will immediatly say 11. How About 23453453 X 56456?

# YOu will start searching for a calculator or jump to a new tab to calculate the same. This 100 day of series will help you learn python from starting to the end. We will start from 0 and by the time we end this course, I promise you will be a job ready python developer!
