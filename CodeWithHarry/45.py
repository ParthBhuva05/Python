# if "_name_ == " _main_" in Python

# The if _name_ == " _main_"  idiom is a common pattern used in Python scripts to determine whether the script is being run directly or being imported as a module into another script.

# In Python, the _name_ variable is a built-in variable that is automatically set to the name of the current module. When a Python script is run directly, the _name_ variable is set to the string _main_ When the script is imported as a module into another script, the _name_ variable is set to the name of the module.

# Why is it useful?

# This idiom is useful because it allows you to reuse code from a script by importing it as a module into another script, without running the code in the original script. For example, consider the following script:

# If you run this script directly, it will output "Running script directly". However, if you import it as a module into another script and call the main function from the imported module, it will not output anything:



# Is it a necessity?

# It's important to note that the if _name_ == " _main"  idiom is not required to run a Python script. You can still run a script without it by simply calling the functions or running the code you want to execute directly. However, the if __name_ ==  _main_ idiom can be a useful tool for organizing and separating code that should be run directly from code that should be imported and used as a module.

# In summary, the if _name_ == " _main_" idiom is a common pattern used in Python scripts to determine whether the script is being run directly or being imported as a module into another script. It allows you to reuse code from a script by importing it as a module into another script, without running the code in the original script.
